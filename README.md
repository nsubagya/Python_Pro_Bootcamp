# Python_Pro_Bootcamp
This is outcome of Python_Pro_Bootcamp projects include a lot of codes in the same file. This includes,
-Day 1 print function (most basic rules for printing functions)
-Band name generator (This is along with an error testing script as well. This code is a fun code to find out a band name using childhood pet and your city)
-Then more about printing, variables, loops and functions
-BMI and later BMI 2.0, developed version of BMI calculator (This is one of the simplest codes using functions loops and conditions. Comments in this script are according to doctors and health proffesionals)
-Life in weeks (This gives the number of weeks you are going to be on the planet earth assuming you will live 90 years, this is from Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks article)
-Odd or even? (This is to check a number is odd or even number using if statments, int and print)
-Leap year (This program works out whether if a given year is a leap year. On every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder, except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder, unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder. This code includes Leap year and Leap year 2.0 more pythonic code as well)
-Pizza order practice (This comes along with a more advanced pythonic Pizza order practice 2.0 version which can order more pizzas in same go. This is an automatic pizza order program. Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.)
-Love Calculator (This is a fun python script, This is a program that tests the compatibility between two people. To work out the love score between two people I used a well known BuzzFeed article).
-Tip calculator (This is a code for calculate tipsa, this gives the tip amount and if needed it will split the bill for you too).
-Heads or tails (This is a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails", this imprted random integers and assigned heads or tails accordingly).
-Banker roulette (This is a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill. Important: Not allowed to use the choice() function.)
-Treasure map (This is to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X. Used lists to obtain the results, this looks preaty simple but can catagorize as a challanging task. This same task can done using index method as well).
-Treasure Island (This is a fun project, this is to find a treasure game with a background adventure story, can change according to your nesasity. This game ask for inputs in between code is running. use ASCII arts and loops to write this code).
-Rollercoaster ticketing (This perticuler code has Rollercoaster ticketing 2.0, Rollercoaster ticketing 3.0 and Rollercoaster ticketing 4.0. From basic tickating method to advanced tickating which can enter several people in one time and wrote in a pythonic way. This python code is to find total bill for rollercoaster ride).
-Average Height (This is a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights. This concept is very simple but in this case we did not use the sum() or len() functions in the code. This code has a more pythonic Average Height 2.0 as well).
-High score (This is a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores. Although this is a very easy task with max and min functions we are not allowed to use the max or min functions in this code. This code also have a High score 2.0 more pythonic script).
-Adding even numbers (This is a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to X. If X is 100 then the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100, in this case we have a more pythonic and slightly advanced script Adding even numbers 2.0 witch can get more inputs)
-FIZZBUZZ (This is a program that automatically prints the solution to the famouse FizzBuzz game. This one is very simple and basic code.)
